              <p class="u-text u-text-1"> <br>Autonomous Vehicles (AV) are vehicles that drive with varying degrees of
                human attention involved. AV utilizes control algorithms and Global Positioning Systems (GPS) to
                navigate their journey while avoiding hazards. In order for the cars to ‘see’, they use Light Detection
                and Ranging (LIDAR) technology. LIDAR is a remote sensing method that uses narrow infrared laser pulses
                to scan and render oncoming objects (NOAA, 2021). <br> <br>

                AVs have been classified into six levels of automation in a standard (J3016TM) by the Society of
                Automotive Engineers (SAE) to explain the varying degrees of development:

                <br>
              <ol start="0">
                <li> No automated features. </li>
                <li>Driver assisting vehicles that can automate breaking and steering, however not simultaneously.
                </li>
                <li>Semi-automated vehicles that can break and steer simultaneously but still require a human’s
                  attention at all times
                </li>
                <li>Conditionally automated vehicles in which drivers are able to temporarily take their eyes off the
                  road </li>
                <li>High level automated vehicles that essentially have full control, however still features a driving
                  wheel and drivers seat
                </li>
                <li>Fully automated vehicles with no steering wheel in which the car drives the human. </li>
              </ol><br>
              <br>
              ‘The U.S. Department of Transportation (DoT) uses J3016’s six levels of automation for on-road motor
              vehicles … and the document became a de facto global standard adopted by stakeholders in the automated
              vehicle technology.’ (SAE International, 2021, para. 4)

              <br> <br> At the forefront of this technology is the Tesla autopilot. The present autopilot model
              available is classified as a level 2 self-driving car, however, ‘All new Tesla cars come standard with
              advanced hardware capable of providing autopilot features today, and full self-driving capabilities in the
              future—through software updates designed to improve functionality over time.’ (Tesla, 2021, para 1.) The
              autopilot employs a range of safety features like automatic emergency braking and high-beams, front and
              side collision warnings. <br><br>
              Experts and developers predict that we will have relatively accessible level three automated vehicles
              within the decade (Business Insider, 2019), however high level automation will take several decades to
              develop safely. Apart from the technology itself, there are many other factors that push the development
              of higher level AV further into the future. Firstly, many roads do not have appropriate road lines plus
              signage is not well refined enough to support the vehicles. AVs require clear and specific lines and
              signage in order for their sensors and LIDAR technology to safely navigate. <br><br>
              Furthermore, the cars would all need to be wirelessly connected to the traffic infrastructure as well as
              other vehicles to collect important information to safely navigate and to help ease congestion. Some
              companies such as Vovlo already use cloud-based services such as Sensus Connect to provide better
              navigation and a more comfortable, convenient driving experience. Sensus Connect includes features like
              Park&Pay. ‘Park&Pay is the world-first integrated solution for finding and paying for parking from within
              your car. The application is based on car2infrastructure communication and points the way of new
              possibilities when the car starts to “communicate” with its surroundings’ (Volvo, 2014, para. 5).
              Eventually similar cloud-based technology will be used universally to connect cars to traffic
              infrastructure. <br><br>

              As AVs become more common, regulation would have to be considered to cover liability for any accidents
              that do occur involving AV. For instance, in the case of an accident, who is held accountable for the
              damage, the owner of the vehicle or the manufacturer? The National Transport Commission (NTC) of Australia
              already has a reform program that aims to implement laws to support the safe use of high-level AV on our
              roads. ‘Our reform program focuses on achieving national consistency. Our goal is end-to-end regulation to
              support the safe commercial deployment and operation of automated vehicles at all levels of automation in
              Australia.’ (National Transport Commission, 2018, para. 2) Until we have laws to police the potential
              accidents and issues involving AV, we cannot have them on our roads.

                this technology, both positive and negative. A self driving car gives commuters the opportunity to
                unlock more time for leisure or work and overall helps to increase productivity. Daily hours spent
                behind the wheel, stuck in traffic could now be used to catch up on work, tv shows or even sleep. The
                elimination of human error, replacing a driver with a system that has increased reaction time, acute
                attention to detail and cannot be distracted or impaired by external factors makes the road a much safer
                place to be. In a level 5 AV, time spent searching for a parking spot will be a thing of the past,
                passengers will simply be able to get dropped at their destination and the car will then proceed to park
                itself. The vehicle systems being connected and able to communicate with one another, along with traffic
                infrastructure, allows for reduced traffic jams and an overall smarter commute.

                In contrast to these positive impacts, there are negative aspects to be considered. The convenience of
                this new technology comes at a rather large cost, with a multitude of jobs in many different industries
                being negatively affected ‘It is projected that globally there will be wide-scale redundancies among
                drivers in the trucking, taxi, ride-share, courier, and food-delivery industries, and workers in other
                related industries, such as warehousing and manufacturing, are also likely to be greatly affected.’
                (Pettigrew, Fritschi & Norman, 2018, p.1) The financial cost of the extra hardware including sensors and
                cameras, along with the necessary software to run an autonomous vehicle will be costly and therefore car
                ownership is predicted to drastically decrease, with many opting to rent the cars when needed instead.

                <br> The development of this technology could empower people, such as myself, who do not have a license
                to be able to safely travel in private vehicles. However, with the cheapest autopilot enabled Tesla
                currently priced at over seventy thousand dollars (Tesla, N.D), it’s unlikely that I would be prepared
                to invest in an AV anytime soon. <br><br>

                If I were to make the investment, it would save me lots of time. Rather than catching public transport,
                which involves long wait times and indirect routes, I could be transported privately and directly to my
                destination. Additionally, being part of a more vulnerable demographic at night time as a female, it
                would make nights out a lot safer. Rather than using rideshare apps or risking catching public transport
                alone, I could rely on the safety of a self-driving car taking me door to door. <br><br>

                The use of autonomous vehicles on our roads to some degree has already begun, with a wider, more common
                and higher-level use on the horizon within decades. As more people embrace AV, my friends, family and
                myself will all be safer on the roads, whether it be in privately owned vehicles or public transport.
                These self-driving cars offer an inarguable convenience and an interesting solution to many current
                issues faced by commuters, however as a society we still have a long way to go in considering the moral,
                legal and technological challenges that we face in order to safely and thoughtfully execute this new
                technology.
