                        <p class="u-text u-text-1">Cybersecurity is a broad discipline that works to identify and protect against cybercrime. With over 3.4 billion users of the internet worldwide, cybersecurity is an essential tool to protect our data against the ever growing threat of cybercrime (Murdoch University, 2020). The Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC) defines cybercrime as “the use of a computer or online network to commit crimes such as fraud, online image abuse, identity theft or threats and intimidation” (ACSC, N.D).  <br>
                            <br>Common cyber attacks on individuals include: 
                            <ul>
                            <li>Malware - software that gains unauthorised access to devices or networks. Commonly executed in the form of viruses, worms or trojans</li>
                            <li>Phishing - often disguised as an email, phishing attacks attempt to collect sensitive data such as credit card details</li>
                            <li>Man-in-the-middle (MIM) - when communications between two parties is intercepted by an unauthorised third party</li>
                          </ul>
                            <br>Many data-conscious individuals use antivirus software to protect themselves online. Antivirus software identifies and prevents malicious software from being downloaded to your device. Developers work continually to build an extensive database of all known malware, so that the software can use this database to scan any incoming data to the network for viruses. We are constantly threatened by new types of malware, in fact an estimated 60,000 new pieces of malware are created daily, so developers must constantly work to keep up with the hackers (Webroot, N.D). Often antivirus software is bundled with additional security tools such as Virtual Private Networks (VPN). VPNs mask your IP address to allow anonymous browsing of the web. Through encryption, VPNs protect personal data online to prevent phishing attacks. Additionally, VPNs feature anti-spyware features that prevent hackers from gaining access to webcams or keylogging inputs. <br>
                            <br>The development of password managers has empowered users to increase their security online. Two-factor authentication is used to securely store all your passwords in one place. These programs often feature a password generator which randomly generates unique alphanumeric passwords for users. Password strength is essential in cybersecurity as “the stronger your password, the more protected your computer will be from hackers and malicious software” (University of Ottowa, N.D). <br>
                            <br>While antivirus software protects your device from internal attacks, firewalls work to protect your network from external attacks. Firewalls work by inspecting all incoming and outgoing packets from the network for malicious software. However, firewalls still leave a device vulnerable to internal attacks as they do not authenticate individual users when determining who can access a network (Indiana University, 2020). As such, firewalls should be treated as an initial step to protecting your data but should be paired with other technologies such as antivirus software. <br>
                            <br>Cyber attacks on organisations tend to be more sophisticated and require a more tailored approach. Statistics suggest that the larger an organisation becomes, the more vulnerable they are to cybercrime (BBC, N.D). To address the increasing threat of cybercrime, organisations consult, or employ cybersecurity professionals who work to analyse and optimise the organisations cybersecurity systems. Ethical hacking is a method used by these experts to attempt to hack an organization's system. This way, cybersecurity experts can identify any weaknesses in the organisations cybersecurity measure and work to strengthen them. With increasing occurrences of cybercrimes against organisations, such as the recent ransomware attack on Channel 9, it is evident that organisations need to continue to invest in cybersecurity measures to protect themselves and their customers (Briggs, T., Visentin, L. & Ilanbey, S., 2021). <br>
                            <br>To sum up, cybersecurity is a fail-safe plan to protect from any digital attacks. There is no one-stop-shop for preventing cybercrime, a diverse use of tools and technologies is key to protecting yourself online. As hackers continue to become more sophisticated, so too must our cybersecurity measures. <br>

                        <p class="u-text u-text-3">Interestingly, unlike other areas of IT, the technology related to Cybersecurity develops alongside the technology used by malicious individuals and organisations, meaning that the technology is constantly changing and evolving.  <br>
                            <br>Even though there are developments in cyber security, we can never actually say that we are “safe”. For example, security software such as antivirus applications can only detect what is already known, although this may be good enough to protect systems at the present, newly created Malicious software can possibly break through those applications and cause all sorts of trouble, therefore security software will always evolve to include more and more potential risks to their databases. <br>
                            <br>There are many potential dangers and impacts of cybersecurity breaches for anyone, from large corporations down to individuals. In 2012 the popular service LinkedIn had a data breach that compromised nearly 6.5 million encrypted passwords (Velazco, C., 2012). <br>
                            <br>Unfortunately the most vulnerable demographic of people that are most affected by cyber crime is the elderly generation as they have limited experience and education about recent technological advancements (Federal Bureau of Investigation Internet Crime Complaint Center IC3, 2018). They are often targeted by phishing scams both online and via telephone, usually to steal money or identity; amongst other types of cybercrime. <br>
                            <br>Changes will hopefully be made in terms of education on cybersecurity and educating users. New applications are being made available such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNS), antivirus and encrypted messaging applications. Upgrades and updates to existing applications, systems, networks and technologies will also likely happen to create a safer digital environment.<br>
                            <br>Due to the nature of cybersecurity and new, and potentially dangerous cyber threats, there is a demand for cybersecurity professionals. According to an article written on Seek “the ACSC found 90% of Australian organisations faced some form of attempted or successful cyber security compromise during 2015-16.” (Niesche, C., N.D)<br>

                        <p class="u-text u-text-5">In this current era a lot of daily life is now conducted through electronics; messaging, banking and various types of work related data are all stored electronically. Friends, family members and ourselves check our inbox for electronic mail which might contain sensitive information. Most of us check and use social media to share pictures amongst other things, in fact in 2020 3.6 Billion people used social media according to Statista (Tankovska, H., 2021) and 3.9 Billion according to backlinko (Dean, B., 2021). Many people we know shop online and when they buy items in store, many of them will opt to use EFTPOS (Electronic funds transfer at point of sale.)<br>
                            <br>As it is now extremely difficult not to use any form of electronic service, a lot of our personal information and data is on the internet whether we like it or not. Unfortunately, as it is in the physical world, there are many individuals and organisations that have malicious intent. These individuals and organizations create what is known as cyber threats which can exploit many different areas. Some are after information, some are there to try and steal money. There are many ways and strategies these people use to achieve such exploits, many use malware while others make use of scams. According to the ACSC Annual Cyber Threat Report 2019-20,  the Australian Cyber Security Centre responded to 2,266 cyber security incidents during that time (Australian Cyber Security Centre, 2021). <br>
                            <br>Caution must be used when engaging in electronic activities especially when online as seemingly inconsequential decisions can lead to severe outcomes for users. Thankfully for users like ourselves, our families and friends there are many products offered that may improve our safety and security in cyberspace such as VPNS, security applications and encrypted messaging services such as Signal. Additionally there are organizations like the Australian Cyber Security Centre that can assist in education and instruction on Cyber security and Cyber threats.<br>
